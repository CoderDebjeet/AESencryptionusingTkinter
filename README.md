# AESencryptionusingTkinter
A small project on AES Encyption using python(Tkinter) .Pycrypto package based Simple-AES-Cipher 
The AES Encryption algorithm (also known as the Rijndael algorithm) is a symmetric block cipher algorithm with a block/chunk size of 128 bits. It converts these individual blocks using keys of 128, 192, and 256 bits. Once it encrypts these blocks, it joins them together to form the ciphertext.
